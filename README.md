## Final Report and Specifications

**Intro/Motivation:**
Greta Thunberg’s activism has played a leading role in the global discourse of climate change. Since her first solitary school strike in August 2018, Thunberg has managed to galvanize millions and influence people who had not previously been interested in her agenda. This “Greta Thunberg Effect” has contributed to a surge in climate change conversations on social media and drawn in a diverse array of voices, especially on Twitter.
Motivated by this significant shift, we wanted to examine climate change related tweets during the height of Thunberg’s influence (2018-2020) and interpret the impact of her activism on public sentiment. What shifts in sentiment can be observed in climate change discourse during this period and how do these shifts correlate with key moments in Thunberg’s activism?
In this project, we scraped approximately 100,000 tweets from both the United States and European Union and analyzed sentiment separately to understand the nuances of public opinion in two different geopolitical regions.


**Data:** (Vibha) TWScrape uses the Twitter API to scrape search results; we used it to acquire Tweets with the keywords 'Greta Thunberg' and 'climate change' across 2018, 2019, and 2020.
